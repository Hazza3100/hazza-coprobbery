**Installation Instructions**

**1.** Download the script from the GitHub repository.

**2.** Extract the downloaded file and copy the "hazza-coprobbery" folder to your FiveM server's resources folder.

**3.** Open your server.cfg file and add the following line: ensure or start hazza-coprobbery

**Usage**

To use the Hazza Cop Robbery script in-game, players must first locate a cop in a random location within the game world. Once a cop is found, players can initiate the robbery by clicking the required key when prompted. The script will then generate a randomized reward for the player, either in the form of items or cash, and apply a cooldown period to prevent immediate reuse of the command.

**Customization**

The script is highly customizable, with various settings that can be configured to suit your server's needs. Here are some of the configurable settings:

• **Cooldown Time**: This setting determines the amount of time between each use of the robbery. The default value is 500 seconds.

• **Cash Reward Range**: This setting determines the range of cash rewards that can be generated by the script. The default range is between $200 and $600.

• **Item Reward List**: This setting determines the list of items that can be rewarded to players. The default list includes items such as weapons, chains, and watches.

These settings can be modified.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues with the script, here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:

Check that the script is properly installed and started in your server.cfg file.
Ensure that all required dependencies, such as qb-core, are installed and working correctly.
Verify that the script's configuration settings are correct and match your server's specifications.
Contact the script's developer for additional support or assistance.
We hope you enjoy using Hazza Cop Robbery and that it adds an exciting new element to your FiveM gaming experience!
